Problem

Unsustainable domestic usage of electrical energy &
User unawareness of the current(present) usage of the electricity until the bill arrives.

Solution

A mobile application using which users can,
set a desired bill payment or a desired energy units usage per month,
monitor the current(present) usage of the electricity for the month,
get notifications when the desired usage at any day(according to the user's desired monthly payment) is exceeded,
get notifications when pre-set percentages of the desired monthly usage is reached.
(The sensor connected to the energy meter will send input to the app using IOT device.) 
  
 
Technologies
 
Hybrid mobile application development(ionic framework),
IOT technology(raspberry pi/arduino) & 
Reflective IR sensor/ current sensor to get input
